# Flight Management Program

This is one of my school project

The purpose of this assignment/project is to practice *Object oriented program*

The program includes 2 main base classes named `Flight` and `Passenger`, and their variation:
- Frequent Passenger tracks the number of flight the Passenger has booked.
- Standby Passenger recieves the least priority among Passenger. 

Some of topic cover:
* Inheritance - Composition
* Polymorphism - and its application
* IObersverable - IObserver
